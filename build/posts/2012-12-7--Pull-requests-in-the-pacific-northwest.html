<p>The past couple months here in Portland have gone better than I could have imagined.
After only two weeks I met <a href="https://twitter.com/joestump/">Joe Stump</a> at Urban
Airship . He gave me some very encouraging words, and some great advice on working
in startups and the tech industry. Through him I met
<a href="https://github.com/mattrobenolt/">Matt Robenolt</a>, who he worked with on
<a href="https://sprint.ly/">sprint.ly</a>. Fortunatly for me, Matt saw potential in me and
brought me on to help out at <a href="https://tixie.com">tixie</a>. I&#39;m amazed at how
much I have been able to learn in such a short time. In Lynchburg I was building
wordpress themes and geeking over CSS hacks until 2-3am nightly, and working full
time as a mechanic. Now I&#39;m contributing to open source projects and building
my own web apps.</p>
<p>As much as I enjoyed working with my hands in shops, nothing compares to having
a job where you literally learn something daily.</p>
<p>Really rad projects releasing fairly soon, promise.</p>
