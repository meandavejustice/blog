<h2 id="fresh-start">Fresh Start</h2>

<p>After a 7 day drive from Lynchburg to Nashville, through Chicago, and Yellowstone. We finally arrived in Oregon!</p>
<p>After signing our lease and unloading the trailers, I headed to see <a href="http://www.reddons.com/">Red Dons</a> play in the back of <a href="http://www.blackwaterpdx.com/">Black Water Records</a>. Wandered around a bit after google maps took me to an empty construction site, but I found the venue just in time for Red Dons to go on. They played a super energetic show with the singer, bassist, and guitarist continuously running/falling into the crowd. Picked up a couple cool records from A.P.P.L.E. Dios Mio, and Infest. Everyone I talked to was super friendly, which was refreshing coming from the east coast. Basically 90% of all the people I have encountered since being here have been super helpful.</p>
<p>This past week was about as equally rad as productive.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Saw Purity Ring</p>
</li>
<li><p>Visited a bunch of local startups</p>
</li>
<li><p>Saw Danny Brown</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed a lot of stuff with the back end of this blog</p>
</li>
<li><p>Got a bike</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, bought a book on Rails 3, gunna spend some time this week doing tutorials. I am probably gunna be posting some of the process on here. As well as links to any code on my Github.</p>
