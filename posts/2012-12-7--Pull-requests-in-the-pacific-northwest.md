## Pull Requests in the Pacific Northwest

The past couple months here in Portland have gone better than I could have imagined.
After only two weeks I met [Joe Stump](https://twitter.com/joestump/) at Urban
Airship . He gave me some very encouraging words, and some great advice on working
in startups and the tech industry. Through him I met
[Matt Robenolt](https://github.com/mattrobenolt/), who he worked with on
[sprint.ly](https://sprint.ly/). Fortunatly for me, Matt saw potential in me and
brought me on to help out at [tixie](https://tixie.com). I'm amazed at how
much I have been able to learn in such a short time. In Lynchburg I was building
wordpress themes and geeking over CSS hacks until 2-3am nightly, and working full
time as a mechanic. Now I'm contributing to open source projects and building
my own web apps.

As much as I enjoyed working with my hands in shops, nothing compares to having
a job where you literally learn something daily.

Really rad projects releasing fairly soon, promise.
